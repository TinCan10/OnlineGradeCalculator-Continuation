Hi @everyone, with assignment 3 starting we should get ready for the programming section. For this assignment, there are three main functions that I believe need to happen for the code:
1 – There needs to be a function to calculate the grade and alter the student’s final grade using the score that the student enters.
2 – When a user opens the application for the first time, there will be a single bar asking them to add an assignment, max points, grade weight, and their score. We need a function add a new bar each time the student enters in information about the assignment (and maybe an error message if they do not finish entering information about the previous assignment).
3 – There should be a function to save and load a student’s grade, so they do not have to re-enter everything each time they use the software. This will probably go to a text file since its only a prototype, but I want to at least provide a way to export the student’s score somehow (if we can’t add the score back into the software it’s no problem).
Make sure to add any file to the GitHub page that I linked earlier in the server, once everything is ready we can make a recording of the software and send it to the professor on Friday. If anyone needs help with JavaScript, here is the link to some documentation for it: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/javascript

7/19/22 - I just finished function 2 to add more assignments. It is currently a button.

7/21/22 - I just added function 1 to the functions.js file.

7/23/22 - Note:
Hi @everyone, with the last few days coming up for the assignment I wanted to go over a few things:

- With the due date coming up soon I really need people to start uploading their work to GitHub and making it work with the files already present. I will not be able to help connect them after tomorrow so please upload anything you have by tomorrow and try to get it working with what we already have.

- In addition to uploading your work to GitHub, please put a comment in the file explaining what you did for your work so you can get credit.

- If you cannot finish your work, upload it to GitHub and add a comment explaining what you were trying to do.

- I want to reiterate that I WILL NOT be able to do anything after Sunday, so please try to upload anything you have tonight or sometime early tomorrow.

With what we have for the current project, here is what we need to do:

- Add any JavaScript functions that help fulfill user requirements without messing with what is already present.

- Clean up the UI as the professor directed in his email. I would rather we focus on fixing the section with the actual grade calculator before we start adding more things relating to the UI.

As it stands right now, the only part of the software we have right now is the calculator itself. We should be focusing on fixing up the section involving the grade calculator, as it is the main point of the prototype.
Here is another link to the GitHub file repository that will be used for submitting the final project: https://github.com/TinCan10/GradeCalculator.
